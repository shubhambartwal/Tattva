            We’re <span className="font-semibold">Tattva Photography & Films</span> —your friendly neighborhood wedding photography ninjas. 
            We sneak around (in the best way possible) to capture all those candid moments, from grandma’s epic dance moves to 
            the tear in your partner’s eye when they see you walk down the aisle. Our job? To turn your big day into a collection 
            of stunning memories that make you smile every time you look back.

            We know weddings can be a rollercoaster of emotions and chaos, but don't worry! We thrive on the madness and bring a 
            sense of calm (and fun!) to the mix. Whether it’s a small, intimate ceremony or a wild, all-night party, we’re there 
            with cameras ready and creativity on full blast.
          </p>

            So, if you’re looking for a team that’ll make you feel relaxed, have a good laugh, and give you photos you’ll cherish 
            forever (without making it feel like a school photo shoot), you’ve come to the right place. Let’s make some magic 
            together—and maybe a little mischief too!
          </p>
